# BmiCalculator
I Dessery lefopane created this BmiCalculator.
This BMI calculator is a program that takes a person's age, sex, ethnicity, height, and weight as input, calculates their Body Mass Index (BMI) using the formula BMI = weight / (height * height), and then categorizes the result (e.g., underweight, normal, overweight, or obese).
It outputs a summary statement combining the user's details with their BMI value and category, helping users understand whether their weight is healthy for their height.
